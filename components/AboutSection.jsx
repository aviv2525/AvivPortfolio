          I’m Aviv, a Computer Science B.Sc. student graduating this year, with deep understanding of
          algorithms, data structures, and software design. I build robust applications in <b>C# .NET</b>,
          and also work with <b>Java</b>, <b>Kotlin (Android)</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> across both
          client and server (React, Node.js). I’m a fast learner with strong analytical skills, able to
          quickly adopt new technologies and solve complex problems efficiently. I care about clean
          architecture, performance, and delivering a great user experience.
